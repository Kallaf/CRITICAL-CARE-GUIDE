                                            Use pancuronium during pregnancy only if the benefits outweigh the risks. It

                                            reproduction capacity. Pancuronium may be used in obstetric delivery (i.e.,

                                            myasthenia gravis, myasthenic syndrome associated with small cell

                                            Neuromuscular blocking agents stimulate histamine release. Compared with

                                            or asthma. In addition, use pancuronium with caution in patients with

                                            conditions that may be associated with a slower circulation time. Changes in

                                            distribution related to poor circulation or edema can delay the onset of
                                            neuromuscular blockade.
                                            Particular care is required when administering subsequent doses when it is

                                            Various physiologic states can alter the expected effects of pancuronium;
                                            carefully consider each
                                            patient's clinical condition when dosing pancuronium and monitoring the
                                            patient. Electrolyte
                                            imbalance can alter a patient's sensitivity to neuromuscular blocking agents
                                            (NMBAs).
                                            Hypercalcemia can decrease sensitivity to NMBAs, while most other

                                            increase sensitivity (e.g., hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypermagnesemia). Use
                                            vecuronium
                                            cautiously in patients with conditions that may lead to electrolyte
                                            imbalances, such as adrenal
                                            insufficiency. Severe acid/base imbalance may alter a patient's sensitivity
                                            to NMBAs: respiratory
                                            acidosis may enhance neuromuscular blockade and metabolic alkalosis may
                                            counteract it.
                                            Dehydration and hypothermia can also increase a patient's sensitivity to
                                            NMBAs.

                                            Pancuronium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease.
                                            The elimination half-life is

                                            Resistance to neuromuscular blockade peaks after about 2 weeks and gradually

                                    Administration requires an experienced clinician who is adequately trained and

                                            Cisatracurium does not cause sedation or analgesia and should be

                                            throughout paralyzation. Doses of cisatracurium should be individualized.

                                            Patients with conditions that impair neuromuscular function can experience
                                            prolonged or
                                            exaggerated neuromuscular blockade after receiving nondepolarizing agents.
                                            These conditions
                                            include myasthenia gravis, myasthenic syndrome (Eaton Lambert syndrome),
                                            myopathy, or any
                                            other neuromuscular disease. A lower maximum initial bolus of 0.02 mg/kg is
                                            recommended in these
                                            patients. Extubation is recommended only after the patient has recovered
                                            significantly from
                                            neuromuscular blockade. Consider use of a reversal agent in cases where
                                            residual paralysis is more
                                            likely to occur. Because the time to neuromuscular blockade is approximately
                                            1 minute slower in
                                            geriatric patients compared to younger patients, consider extending the
                                            interval between
                                            administering cisatracurium and attempting intubation by at least 1 minute
                                            to achieve adequate
                                            intubation conditions. Use a peripheral nerve stimulator to determine the
                                            adequacy of muscle
                                            relaxation for the purposes of intubation and the timing and amounts of
                                            subsequent doses. Patients
                                            with hemiparesis or paraparesis may demonstrate resistance to cisatracurium
                                            in the affected limbs.
                                            To avoid inaccurate dosing, perform neuromuscular monitoring on a
                                            non-paretic limb. Additionally,
                                            patients with weak muscle tone and those who suffer from severe obesity are
                                            at an increased risk for
                                            airway and ventilation complications. Use cisatracurium with caution in
                                            patients with these
                                            conditions, and continue to monitor patients carefully until recovery is
                                            fully complete.

                                            pulmonary conditions. NMBAs stimulate histamine release, which could
                                            exacerbate asthma. In
                                            addition, NMBAs cause respiratory muscle paralysis; residual muscle weakness

                                            Patients with burns have been shown to develop resistance to nondepolarizing

                                            blocking agents. The extent of altered response depends upon the size of the

                                            elapsed since the burn injury. Cisatracurium has not been studied in burn
                                            patients; however, due to
                                            its structural similarity to atracurium, the possibility of increased dosage
                                            requirements and a
                                            shortened duration of action must be considered if cisatracurium is
                                            administered to burn patients.

                                            Various physiologic states can alter the expected effects of cisatracurium;
                                            carefully consider each
                                            patient's clinical condition when dosing cisatracurium and monitoring the
                                            patient. Cachectic and
                                            debilitated patients are more sensitive to neuromuscular blocking agents
                                            (NMBAs). Electrolyte
                                            imbalance can alter a patient's sensitivity to NMBAs. Hypercalcemia can
                                            decrease sensitivity to
                                            NMBAs, while most other electrolyte disturbances increase sensitivity (e.g.,
                                            hypokalemia,
                                            hypocalcemia, hypermagnesemia). Use cisatracurium cautiously in patients
                                            with conditions that may
                                            lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as adrenal insufficiency. Severe
                                            acid/base imbalance may alter
                                            a patient's sensitivity to NMBAs: metabolic alkalosis, metabolic acidosis,
                                            and respiratory acidosis
                                            may enhance neuromuscular blockade and/or prolong recovery time, while
                                            respiratory alkalosis
                                            reduces the potency of the drug. Dehydration and hypothermia can also
                                            increase a patient's
                                            sensitivity to NMBAs.

                                            assisted or controlled ventilation. Reversal agents should also be

                                            After the initial intubating dose (0.6 mg/kg IV), maintenance doses must be
                                            individualized and
                                            administered only after there is evidence of spontaneous recovery of
                                            neuromuscular function.
                                            According to the manufacturer, doses of 0.1, 0.15, or 0.2 mg/kg IV, given

                                            <h4>Infants, Children, and Adolescents</h4>
                                            0.075 to 0.15 mg/kg/dose IV as needed after initial paralysis is achieved.
                                            Adjust the dose and interval as needed to maintain adequate paralysis.
                                            <h4>Neonates</h4>
                                            0.075 to 0.15 mg/kg/dose IV as needed after initial paralysis is achieved.
                                            Adjust the dose and interval as needed to maintain adequate paralysis.
                                            <h4>Continuous Intravenous Infusion dosage</h4>
                                            Adults
                                            Initial infusion rate is 10 to 12 mcg/kg/minute (0.6 to 0.72 mg/kg/hour) IV
                                            only after there is evidence
                                            of spontaneous recovery from the intubating dose. Additional bolus doses may
                                            be needed if
                                            neuromuscular blockade returns to more than 10% of control. Once desired
                                            level of neuromuscular
                                            blockade is reached, infusion rates must be individualized. In clinical
                                            trials, infusion rates ranged
                                            from 4 to 16 mcg/kg/minute (0.24 to 0.96 mg/kg/hour).
                                            <h4>Infants, Children, and Adolescents</h4>
                                            5 to 12 mcg/kg/minute (0.3 to 0.72 mg/kg/hour) IV after initial paralysis is
                                            achieved.
                                            Children (2 to 11 years) generally have the largest dosage requirement.
                                            <h4>Neonates</h4>
                                            5 to 12 mcg/kg/minute (0.3 to 0.72 mg/kg/hour) IV after initial paralysis is
                                            achieved.
                                            Neonates generally have the lowest dosage requirement and should be
                                            initiated at the lower end of
                                            the dosing range.

                                            asthma or other
                                            pulmonary conditions. NMBAs stimulate histamine release, which could
                                            exacerbate asthma.
                                            Compared with other NMBAs, rocuronium produces little or no histamine
                                            release. While some
                                            experts consider rocuronium to be an NMBA of choice in asthmatic patients,
                                            it should be used with

                                            contraindicated. In
                                            addition, NMBAs cause respiratory muscle paralysis; residual muscle weakness
                                            and decreased
                                            respiratory function (respiratory depression) can persist even after drug
                                            discontinuation. Use NMBAs
                                            with caution in patients with pulmonary disease and conditions associated
                                            with low pulmonary

                                            disease (COPD). Carefully monitor respiratory status and adequacy of

                                            Various physiologic states can alter the expected effects of rocuronium;
                                            carefully consider each
                                            patient's clinical condition when dosing rocuronium and monitoring the
                                            patient. Cachectic and
                                            debilitated patients are more sensitive to neuromuscular blocking agents
                                            (NMBAs). Electrolyte
                                            imbalance can alter a patient's sensitivity to NMBAs. Hypercalcemia can
                                            decrease sensitivity to
                                            NMBAs, while most other electrolyte disturbances increase sensitivity (e.g.,
                                            hypokalemia,
                                            hypocalcemia, hypermagnesemia). Use rocuronium cautiously in patients with
                                            conditions that may
                                            lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as adrenal insufficiency. Severe
                                            acid/base imbalance may alter
                                            a patient's sensitivity to NMBAs: metabolic alkalosis, metabolic acidosis,
                                            and respiratory acidosis
                                            may enhance neuromuscular blockade and/or prolong recovery time, while

                                            reduces the potency of the drug. Dehydration and hypothermia can also
                                            increase a patient's
                                            sensitivity to NMBAs.

                                            Patients with conditions that impair neuromuscular function can experience
                                            prolonged or
                                            exaggerated neuromuscular blockade after receiving nondepolarizing agents.
                                            These conditions
                                            include myasthenia gravis, myasthenic syndrome (Eaton Lambert syndrome),
                                            myopathy, or any
                                            other neuromuscular disease. Geriatric patients may be at increased risk for
                                            residual neuromuscular
                                            block. The use of a peripheral nerve stimulator to assess the level of
                                            neuromuscular block and to
                                            monitor dosage requirements is recommended. Extubation is recommended only
                                            after the patient
                                            has recovered significantly from neuromuscular blockade. Consider use of a
                                            reversal agent in cases
                                            where residual paralysis is more likely to occur. Additionally, patients
                                            with weak muscle tone and
                                            those who suffer from severe obesity are at an increased risk for airway and
                                            ventilation
                                            complications. Use rocuronium with caution in patients with these
                                            conditions, and continue to
                                            monitor patients carefully until recovery is fully complete.

                                            Succinylcholine does not cause sedation or analgesia and ideally should be
                                            administered only after
                                            unconsciousness has been induced; however, in emergent life-threatening
                                            situations, it may be
                                            necessary to administer succinylcholine prior to unconsciousness. Every
                                            effort should be made to
                                            avoid patient distress; amnesia and analgesia should be adequately
                                            maintained throughout
                                            paralyzation. Doses of succinylcholine should be individualized. With
                                            prolonged administration of
                                            succinylcholine, the characteristic depolarization block (Phase I block) can
                                            change to a
                                            nondepolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle
                                            paralysis or weakness may be
                                            observed in patients experiencing this transition to Phase II block.
                                            Anticholinesterase agents (e.g.,
                                            neostigmine) will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block and, if
                                            Phase II block is
                                            suspected, diagnosis with a peripheral nerve stimulator should precede the
                                            administration of a
                                            reversal agent. In general, use of a peripheral nerve stimulator will permit
                                            the most advantageous
                                            use of a neuromuscular blocking agent, minimize the possibility of
                                            overdosage or underdosage, and
                                            assist in the evaluation of recovery.

                                            Succinylcholine is contraindicated in patients after the acute phase of
                                            injury after major burns,
                                            multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor
                                            neuron injury.
                                            Succinylcholine administration to such patients can cause severe
                                            hyperkalemia, which can result in
                                            cardiac arrest. Risk for hyperkalemia in such patients increases over time
                                            and usually peaks 7 to 10
                                            days after the injury; however, the precise onset and duration of the risk
                                            period are unknown. Risk is
                                            dependent on extent and location of injury. Additionally, succinylcholine
                                            should be administered with
                                            great caution in patients with electrolyte imbalances and those who take
                                            digoxin and may have
                                            digitalis toxicity, as succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia may cause
                                            serious cardiac arrhythmias
                                            and cardiac arrest. Succinylcholine should not be used in any patient with a
                                            serum potassium more
                                            than 5.5 mEq/L. Chronic abdominal infections, subarachnoid hemorrhage,

                                            Guillain-Barre syndrome, and degenerative nervous system disorders may also
                                            increase the risk for

                                            muscular dystrophy. Although some patients will have no identifiable risk
                                            factors, a careful history
                                            and physical exam may identify developmental delays suggestive of myopathy,
                                            and a preoperative
                                            creatinine kinase could identify some patients at risk. When succinylcholine
                                            is used in pediatric
                                            patients, closely monitor body temperature, expired CO2, heart rate, blood
                                            pressure, and
                                            electrocardiogram; careful monitoring may help detect early signs of
                                            malignant hyperthermia and/or
                                            hyperkalemia. The rhabdomyolysis syndrome often presents as peaked T-waves
                                            and sudden
                                            cardiac arrest within minutes after succinylcholine administration. Many
                                            affected patients are males
                                            and 8 years of age or younger; however, cases have also been reported in
                                            females and
                                            adolescents. Bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, has also been
                                            reported more commonly
                                            in infants and children, as well as in patients receiving repeated doses,
                                            intravenous administration
                                            (compared to intramuscular administration), or concurrent agents that have
                                            negative chronotropic
                                            effects (e.g., halothane, propofol, fentanyl). Pretreatment with
                                            anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine)
                                            may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. If cardiac arrest occurs
                                            immediately after the
                                            administration of succinylcholine, hyperkalemia should be suspected and
                                            managed accordingly
                                            (e.g., intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, glucose with insulin,
                                            hyperventilation). In the presence of
                                            signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment (e.g., dantrolene,
                                            supportive care) should be
                                            initiated concurrently. Because it is difficult to identify which patients
                                            are at risk, it is
                                            recommended
                                            that succinylcholine use in pediatric patients should be reserved for
                                            emergency intubation or
                                            instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary (e.g.,
                                            laryngospasm, difficult airway,
                                            full stomach, or lack of intravenous access); for routine elective surgery,
                                            pediatric patients should
                                            receive nondepolarizing neuromuscular agents.

                                            amounts of the drug do enter the fetal circulation but not in an amount that

                                            recent plasmapheresis therapy. In addition, irreversible inhibitors of
                                            plasma cholinesterase (e.g.,
                                            organophosphate insecticides [cholinesterase inhibitor toxicity],
                                            cyclophosphamide) and chronic
                                            administration of certain drugs (e.g., oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids)
                                            may reduce plasma
                                            cholinesterase activity. It is important to note that onset of neuromuscular
                                            blockade may be delayed
                                            in patients with cardiac disease or other conditions associated with poor
                                            circulation and edema.
                                            Subsequent doses should be administered with caution in any patient with a
                                            predisposition to
                                            delayed onset or prolonged duration of paralysis.

                                            Patients with conditions that impair neuromuscular function can experience
                                            prolonged or
                                            exaggerated neuromuscular blockade after receiving neuromuscular blocking
                                            agents. These
                                            conditions include myasthenia gravis, myasthenic syndrome (Eaton Lambert
                                            syndrome), myopathy,
                                            or any other neuromuscular disease. Because myasthenia gravis involves
                                            destruction of
                                            acetylcholine receptors instead of receptor upregulation, as seen in other
                                            neuromuscular diseases,
                                            these patients tend to be less sensitive to the effects of succinylcholine
                                            compared to nondepolarizing
                                            agents (e.g., rocuronium, vecuronium). In addition to neuromuscular disease,
                                            patients with weak
                                            muscle tone and those who suffer from severe obesity are at an increased
                                            risk for airway and
                                            ventilation complications. Use succinylcholine with caution in patients with
                                            these conditions, and
                                            continue to monitor patients carefully until recovery is fully complete.

                                            specialized care setting. Use succinylcholine only when necessary equipment

                                            in airway management are immediately available. Adequacy of respiration must

                                            discontinuation. Use NMBAs
                                            with caution in patients with pulmonary disease and conditions associated
                                            with low pulmonary
                                            function reserve, such as neonatal chronic lung disease (CLD) or chronic
                                            obstructive pulmonary
                                            disease (COPD). Carefully monitor respiratory status and adequacy of
                                            ventilation after drug recovery
                                            until the patient is clearly stabilized.

                                            Various physiologic states can alter the expected effects of
                                            succinylcholine; carefully consider each
                                            patient's clinical condition when dosing succinylcholine and monitoring the
                                            patient. Cachectic and
                                            debilitated patients are more sensitive to neuromuscular blocking agents.
                                            Electrolyte imbalance can
                                            alter a patient's sensitivity to neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs).
                                            Hypercalcemia can decrease
                                            sensitivity to NMBAs, while most other electrolyte disturbances increase
                                            sensitivity (e.g.,
                                            hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypermagnesemia). Use succinylcholine cautiously
                                            in patients with
                                            conditions that may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as adrenal
                                            insufficiency. Severe acid/base
                                            imbalance may alter a patient's sensitivity to NMBAs: metabolic alkalosis,
                                            metabolic acidosis, and
                                            respiratory acidosis may enhance neuromuscular blockade and/or prolong
                                            recovery time, while
                                            respiratory alkalosis reduces the potency of the drug. Dehydration and
                                            hypothermia can also
                                            increase a patient's sensitivity to NMBAs.

                                            Succinylcholine may cause a transient increased intracranial pressure;

                                            neuromuscular blockers have been
                                            reported; some cases have been fatal. Vecuronium should be used with caution
                                            in patients with a
                                            neuromuscular blocking agent hypersensitivity, as cross-reactivity has been
                                            reported with both
                                            depolarizing and non-depolarizing agents in this class. Immediate
                                            availability of appropriate
                                            emergency treatment for anaphylaxis is advised.

                                            Various physiologic states can alter the expected effects of vecuronium;
                                            carefully consider each
                                            patient's clinical condition when dosing vecuronium and monitoring the
                                            patient. Cachectic and
                                            debilitated patients are more sensitive to neuromuscular blocking agents.
                                            Electrolyte imbalance can
                                            alter a patient's sensitivity to NMBAs. Hypercalcemia can decrease
                                            sensitivity to NMBAs, while most
                                            other electrolyte disturbances increase sensitivity (e.g., hypokalemia,
                                            hypocalcemia,
                                            hypermagnesemia). Use rocuronium cautiously in patients with conditions that
                                            may lead to
                                            electrolyte imbalances, such as adrenal insufficiency. Severe acid/base
                                            imbalance may alter a
                                            patient's sensitivity to NMBAs: metabolic alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and
                                            respiratory acidosis may
                                            enhance neuromuscular blockade and/or prolong recovery time, while
                                            respiratory alkalosis reduces
                                            the potency of the drug. Dehydration and hypothermia can also increase a
                                            patient's sensitivity to
                                            NMBAs.

                                            Use neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), including vecuronium, with
                                            caution in patients with
                                            asthma or other pulmonary conditions. NMBAs stimulate histamine release,
                                            which could exacerbate
                                            asthma. Compared with other NMBAs, vecuronium produces little or no
                                            histamine release. While
                                            some experts consider vecuronium to be an NMBA of choice in asthmatic
                                            patients, it should be used
                                            with caution in those with any condition in which a significant release of
                                            histamine may be
                                            contraindicated. In addition, NMBAs cause respiratory muscle paralysis;
                                            residual muscle weakness
                                            and decreased respiratory function (respiratory depression) can persist even
                                            after drug
                                            discontinuation. Use NMBAs with caution in patients with pulmonary disease
                                            and conditions
                                            associated with low pulmonary function reserve, such as chronic obstructive

                                            (COPD) or neonatal chronic lung disease (CLD). Carefully monitor respiratory
                                            status and adequacy
                                            of ventilation after drug recovery until the patient is clearly stabilized.

                                            Patients with conditions that impair neuromuscular function can experience
                                            prolonged or
                                            exaggerated neuromuscular blockade after receiving nondepolarizing agents.
                                            These conditions
                                            include myasthenia gravis, myasthenic syndrome (Eaton Lambert syndrome),

                                            an increased risk for airway and ventilation complications. Use vecuronium

                                            recovery is fully complete.
                                            Consider the use of a small test dose and a peripheral nerve stimulator to

                                            to 2 hours. It is a
                                            monoquaternary compound and should pass slowly through biological membranes.
                                            If trace amounts
                                            were excreted into breast milk, quaternary muscle relaxants are poorly
                                            absorbed from the
                                            gastrointestinal tract. Based on these data, lactation could be allowed as
                                            soon as practically feasible
                                            after surgery.
