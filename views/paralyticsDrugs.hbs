                                                        intubation conditions. Use a peripheral nerve stimulator to

                                                        relaxation for the purposes of intubation and the timing and

                                                        obesity are
                                                        at an increased risk for
                                                        airway and ventilation complications. Use cisatracurium with

                                    Succinylcholine is contraindicated in patients after the acute phase of injury after
                                    major burns,
                                    multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron
                                    injury.
                                    Succinylcholine administration to such patients can cause severe hyperkalemia, which
                                    can result in
                                    cardiac arrest. Risk for hyperkalemia in such patients increases over time and
                                    usually peaks 7 to 10
                                    days after the injury; however, the precise onset and duration of the risk period
                                    are unknown. Risk is
                                    dependent on extent and location of injury. Additionally, succinylcholine should be
                                    administered with
                                    great caution in patients with electrolyte imbalances and those who take digoxin and
                                    may have
                                    digitalis toxicity, as succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia may cause serious
                                    cardiac arrhythmias
                                    and cardiac arrest. Succinylcholine should not be used in any patient with a serum
                                    potassium more
                                    than 5.5 mEq/L. Chronic abdominal infections, subarachnoid hemorrhage, tetanus,
                                    disuse atrophy,
                                    Guillain-Barre syndrome, and degenerative nervous system disorders may also increase
                                    the risk for
                                    hyperkalemia.

                                    </h5>

                                    Succinylcholine is contraindicated in patients with a personal or familial history
                                    of malignant
                                    hyperthermia and/or skeletal muscle myopathy. Malignant hyperthermia may be
                                    precipitated by
                                    succinylcholine; concomitant use of volatile anesthetics may further increase the
                                    risk of developing
                                    this hypermetabolic state. Use succinylcholine with caution in neonates, infants,
                                    children, and
                                    adolescents; in general, the use of succinylcholine should be limited to very urgent
                                    clinical situations.
                                    There have been rare reports of ventricular dysrhythmias and fatal cardiac arrest
                                    secondary to
                                    rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia, primarily in healthy appearing pediatric patients
                                    who were
                                    subsequently found to have undiagnosed skeletal muscle myopathy, most frequently
                                    Duchenne's
                                    muscular dystrophy. Although some patients will have no identifiable risk factors, a
                                    careful history
                                    and physical exam may identify developmental delays suggestive of myopathy, and a
                                    preoperative
                                    creatinine kinase could identify some patients at risk. When succinylcholine is used
                                    in pediatric
                                    patients, closely monitor body temperature, expired CO2, heart rate, blood pressure,
                                    and
                                    electrocardiogram; careful monitoring may help detect early signs of malignant
                                    hyperthermia and/or
                                    hyperkalemia. The rhabdomyolysis syndrome often presents as peaked T-waves and
                                    sudden
                                    cardiac arrest within minutes after succinylcholine administration. Many affected
                                    patients are males
                                    and 8 years of age or younger; however, cases have also been reported in females and
                                    adolescents. Bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, has also been reported
                                    more commonly
                                    in infants and children, as well as in patients receiving repeated doses,
                                    intravenous administration
                                    (compared to intramuscular administration), or concurrent agents that have negative
                                    chronotropic
                                    effects (e.g., halothane, propofol, fentanyl). Pretreatment with anticholinergic
                                    agents (e.g., atropine)
                                    may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. If cardiac arrest occurs immediately
                                    after the
                                    administration of succinylcholine, hyperkalemia should be suspected and managed
                                    accordingly
                                    (e.g., intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, glucose with insulin, hyperventilation). In
                                    the presence of
                                    signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment (e.g., dantrolene, supportive
                                    care) should be
                                    initiated concurrently. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at
                                    risk, it is recommended
                                    that succinylcholine use in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency
                                    intubation or
                                    instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary (e.g., laryngospasm,
                                    difficult airway,
                                    full stomach, or lack of intravenous access); for routine elective surgery,
                                    pediatric patients should
                                    receive nondepolarizing neuromuscular agents.
